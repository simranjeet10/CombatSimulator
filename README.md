# CombatSimulator


Combat Simulator simulates a simple text-based game involving a player (hero) and monsters. The code uses classes and objects to represent various game entities and functionalities.

The code contains a CombatSimulation class with static methods to simulate combat scenarios between a player and a single monster (SoloCombat) or a group of players against a group of monsters (GroupCombat). The combat is menu-driven, where the user can choose different actions for the player during battles, and the monsters have a chance to make regular or special attacks based on some probabilities.
